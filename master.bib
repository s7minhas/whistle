Unfortunately, that understanding is con-fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limitedits dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it isparticularly important.In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of thesetheoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuitionbehind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex-haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicatedreader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works,when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

@article{capoccia:ziblatt:2010,
	abstract = { This article lays the theoretical and methodological foundations of a new historically minded approach to the comparative study of democratization, centered on the analysis of the creation, development, and interaction of democratic institutions. Historically, democracy did not emerge as a singular coherent whole but rather as a set of different institutions, which resulted from conflicts across multiple lines of social and political cleavage that took place at different moments in time. The theoretical advantage of this approach is illustrated by highlighting the range of new variables that come into focus in explaining democracy's emergence. Rather than class being the single variable that explains how and why democracy came about, scholars can see how religious conflict, ethnic cleavages, and the diffusion of ideas played a much greater role in Europe's democratization than has typically been appreciated. Above all, the authors argue that political parties were decisive players in how and why democracy emerged in Europe and should be at the center of future analyses. },

The fiscal data comprise revenues, primary expenditures, interest bill, and government debt for 55 countries for up to two hundred years. The policy response (increase in the primary fiscal balance in response to debt increases) is found to be significantly weaker when sovereign borrowing costs are low, inflation is high, and potential economic growth worsens unexpectedly. These results are robust to political factors.},

The goal is to solve some of the political and sociological problems of data sharing via technological means, with the result intended to benefit both the scientific community and the sometimes apparently contradictory goals of individual researchers. },

Jordan investigates the effectiveness of leadership decapitation on terrorist groups by assessing the duration of the organization and its tactical capacity following an attack. Using an original data set (1945-2000) Jordan uses measures of group size, age, and organization type as her independent variables and argues that ideological organizations are weaker following decapitation than are religious ones, and younger and smaller organizations are more likely to cease activity following the targeted killing of leader (she measures her DV, effectiveness, in two ways: {F}irstly by group collapse/lifespan and secondly the group's capacity to carry out future attacks following the decapitation). She claims that leadership decapitation is an ineffective counterterrorism strategy because it does not increase the likelihood of the group's collapse. -Can't specifically at whether number of members increases (back lash recruitment) -Predicts individual head leader matters more than upper echelon members.
